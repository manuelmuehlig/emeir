Monitor the counter of an electricity meter with Arduino and infrared light sensor.

The software consists of two parts:

* Data acquisition part running on an Arduino Nano. It controls the infrared light barrier, detects trigger levels and communicates with a master computer over USB serial.
* Data recording part running on a the master computer (Raspberry Pi). It retrieves the data from the Arduino over USB serial and stores counter and consumption values into a round robin database.

There is a blog in german language that explains use case and function: [Infrarot Lichtschranke mit Arduino zum Auslesen des Stromz√§hlers](https://www.kompf.de/tech/emeir.html).


## Commands from host (RasPi) to Arduino

* __D__ - retrieve and print raw data
* __T__ - enter trigger mode and print trigger data (0/1)
* __S__ _sensor_ _low_ _high_ - Set trigger levels (e.g. 0 85 90)
* __C__ - Cancel data acquisition and enter command mode

Arduino is in trigger mode upon start - Send __C__ to enter command mode
